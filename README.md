# Retail Store Analysis
### This project aims to analyze sales data across various product categories and regions during the 2022-2023 period. Using Docker, Apache Airflow, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Kibana, I automated the data pipeline and visualized key business insights.
### The analysis focuses on sales trends, product distribution, competitor price impact, seasonal demand patterns, and strategic recommendations for inventory and promotions.

‚úÖ Analyze sales performance and profitability by product category & region.
‚úÖ Identify demand trends and customer purchasing patterns.
‚úÖ Evaluate the impact of competitor pricing on unit sales.
‚úÖ Assess how weather and seasonal patterns affect demand.
‚úÖ Provide business recommendations for inventory and marketing optimization.

## Target Users
- Sales & Marketing Teams ‚Üí To plan promotions and data-driven marketing campaigns.
- Logistics & Supply Chain Teams ‚Üí To optimize inventory management based on demand trends.
- Executive Management ‚Üí To support strategic decision-making for business expansion & pricing optimization.

## Tools & Technologies Used
```
üîπ Docker ‚Üí Running Airflow, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Kibana in containerized environments.

üîπ PostgreSQL ‚Üí Storing structured sales data for analysis.
üîπ Elasticsearch ‚Üí Enabling high-performance data search & analysis.
üîπ Kibana ‚Üí Creating interactive dashboards for data exploration.
```

## Data Pipeline Workflow
```
This project automates data extraction, transformation, and analysis as follows:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Extract Data from PostgreSQL ‚Üí Raw data is pulled from the database.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Clean & Transform Data ‚Üí Data is processed and formatted using Python & Pandas.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Index Data into Elasticsearch ‚Üí Processed data is uploaded to Elasticsearch for efficient analysis.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Visualize Insights in Kibana ‚Üí Dashboards display key insights such as:

- Sales trends by season & region
- Competitor pricing impact on unit sales
- Analysis of promotion effectiveness & product inventory
```

## Installation Instructions
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
2. Install Docker if you haven't already.
3. Build and start the Docker environment:
```
docker-compose -f .\airflow\airflow.yaml up -d
```
The following services will be started:

- Airflow (for orchestrating the pipeline)
- PostgreSQL (for storing cleaned data)
- Elasticsearch (for indexing data)
- Kibana (for visualizing the data)

Access the services:
- Airflow UI: http://localhost:8080
- Kibana UI: http://localhost:5601

Once the pipeline is running, it will automatically extract, clean, process, and load the data into PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch. You can then explore the data in Kibana.
